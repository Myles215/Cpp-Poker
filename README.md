# Cpp-Poker
Basic poker game that plays in C++ terminal

Can be run with // g++ main.cpp Player.cpp Human.cpp Player.cpp -o poker

This poker game follows the rules of Texas Hold'em poker, a number of players are initialised as objects of either computer or human class
A points system based calculates the 'value' of a players hand to decide the winner at the end of the round. The computer players use this 
scoring system along with an element of random chance to make their moves 'intelligently'

This was one of the first big C++ projects I completed on my own, it made me realise that as a program grows it becomes infinitely more complex
with new variables, classes and functions
